# Website Crawler
This is a main description for the repository:
In the past, I crawled some websites and collectioned their information.
But in the next time I want to use them, I always need to rewrite the code to crawl...

IT IS A NIGHTMARE!

So I want to store my code in here.
The corresponding documentations will list on the different website folders.
